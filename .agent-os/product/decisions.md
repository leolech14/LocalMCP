## 2025-07-26: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

LocalMCP will be an advanced MCP-based AI agent system focusing on production-grade reliability, intelligent tool orchestration, and multi-LLM support. The system addresses critical challenges in scaling MCP architectures for enterprise use.

### Context

The AI ecosystem needs production-ready infrastructure for managing hundreds of MCP tools efficiently. Current solutions lack proper error handling, observability, and optimization for large-scale deployments. LocalMCP fills this gap by providing enterprise-grade features from the ground up.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple MCP Proxy**
   - Pros: Easier to implement, lower complexity
   - Cons: Doesn't solve core scaling issues, limited value proposition

2. **LangChain Integration**
   - Pros: Large ecosystem, existing user base
   - Cons: Heavy framework dependency, less control over optimizations

3. **Cloud-Only Solution**
   - Pros: Easier scaling, managed infrastructure
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, latency concerns, privacy issues

### Rationale

We chose a local-first, framework-agnostic approach to provide maximum flexibility and control while addressing real production needs. The focus on semantic orchestration and circuit breakers directly addresses pain points observed in production AI systems.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear differentiation in the market
- Solves real production problems
- Framework-agnostic design allows broad adoption

**Negative:**
- Higher initial complexity
- Requires more sophisticated implementation
- Longer time to initial release

## 2025-07-26: FAISS for Semantic Search

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, AI Engineers

### Decision

Use FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for semantic tool discovery instead of external vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate.

### Context

The system needs to perform fast semantic search across potentially hundreds of MCP tools. The solution must be local, fast, and not require external dependencies.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Pinecone**
   - Pros: Managed service, easy scaling
   - Cons: External dependency, cost, latency

2. **ChromaDB**
   - Pros: Embedded database, good DX
   - Cons: Less mature, performance concerns at scale

3. **PostgreSQL with pgvector**
   - Pros: Familiar technology, ACID compliance
   - Cons: Requires PostgreSQL, not optimized for similarity search

### Rationale

FAISS provides the best balance of performance, local operation, and maturity. It's battle-tested at Facebook scale and requires no external services, aligning with our local-first philosophy.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- No external dependencies
- Microsecond query latency
- Proven scalability

**Negative:**
- More complex to implement
- Requires careful index management
- No built-in persistence (must implement)

## 2025-07-26: Elastic Circuit De-Constructor Pattern

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, SRE Team

### Decision

Implement a novel "Elastic Circuit De-Constructor" pattern that extends traditional circuit breakers with a "deconstructed" state for graceful degradation.

### Context

Traditional circuit breakers (OPEN/CLOSED/HALF-OPEN) create binary failures. In AI systems, partial functionality is often better than complete failure. We need a pattern that allows degraded operation.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Standard Circuit Breaker**
   - Pros: Well-understood, simple
   - Cons: Binary failure mode, poor UX

2. **Retry with Backoff Only**
   - Pros: Simple to implement
   - Cons: Can overwhelm failing services, no circuit protection

3. **Bulkhead Pattern**
   - Pros: Isolation of failures
   - Cons: Doesn't address gradual degradation

### Rationale

The Elastic Circuit De-Constructor allows services to operate in a degraded mode, providing partial functionality while protecting the failing service. This is crucial for AI systems where some response is better than none.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Better user experience during failures
- Gradual degradation instead of hard failures
- Self-healing capabilities

**Negative:**
- More complex state management
- Requires careful tuning
- Novel pattern requires documentation

## 2025-07-26: Multi-LLM Support Architecture

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, AI Engineers

### Decision

Build multi-LLM support as a first-class feature with a unified gateway, rather than focusing on a single provider.

### Context

The LLM landscape is rapidly evolving with different models excelling at different tasks. Lock-in to a single provider is risky and limits optimization opportunities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **OpenAI Only**
   - Pros: Simplest implementation, most popular
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, availability risks

2. **LangChain's LLM Abstraction**
   - Pros: Existing abstraction, community support
   - Cons: Heavy dependency, less control

3. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility
   - Cons: Higher complexity, fragmentation risk

### Rationale

A unified gateway with built-in support for major providers gives users flexibility while maintaining a clean abstraction. This allows cost optimization, failover, and capability-based routing.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- No vendor lock-in
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Automatic failover capabilities

**Negative:**
- More complex initial implementation
- Need to maintain multiple provider integrations
- Potential for abstraction leaks

## 2025-07-26: Async-First Architecture

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt an async-first architecture using Python's asyncio throughout the codebase.

### Context

AI workloads are I/O bound with many concurrent operations (LLM calls, tool executions). The architecture must efficiently handle high concurrency without thread overhead.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Thread-Based Concurrency**
   - Pros: Familiar model, simpler mental model
   - Cons: GIL limitations, higher overhead

2. **Process-Based Workers**
   - Pros: True parallelism, isolation
   - Cons: Higher memory usage, complex state sharing

3. **Hybrid (Threads + Async)**
   - Pros: Flexibility for CPU-bound tasks
   - Cons: Complexity, two mental models

### Rationale

Async-first with asyncio provides the best model for I/O-bound AI workloads. It's efficient, well-supported in the Python ecosystem, and aligns with modern Python practices.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Excellent concurrency handling
- Lower resource usage
- Modern Python patterns

**Negative:**
- Steeper learning curve
- Careful library selection needed
- Potential for subtle bugs

## 2025-07-26: Docker Compose for Local Development

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, DevOps

### Decision

Use Docker Compose for local development infrastructure rather than requiring manual service installation.

### Context

The system requires multiple infrastructure services (Redis, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger). Developer experience is crucial for adoption.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Installation Guides**
   - Pros: No Docker requirement
   - Cons: Poor DX, version inconsistencies

2. **All-in-One Container**
   - Pros: Single container simplicity
   - Cons: Not production-like, harder debugging

3. **Kubernetes for Local**
   - Pros: Production-like environment
   - Cons: High complexity, resource intensive

### Rationale

Docker Compose provides the right balance of simplicity and production similarity. It's widely adopted and provides consistent environments across developers.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Consistent development environments
- Easy onboarding
- Production-similar setup

**Negative:**
- Docker requirement
- Resource usage on developer machines
- Some complexity for Docker newcomers
